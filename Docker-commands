1- Run- start a container
# docker run nginx  >> will run instance of nginx application on docker host. If the image is not present on the host it will pull the img from docker hub

2- ps- list containers
# docker ps   >> List all running containers and some basic info about them 

To see all containers running or not use -a option
# docker ps -a

3- stop- stop container
# docker stop container_name or id

4- rm-remove container 
What if we want to get rid of the stopped container which is consuming space we can use rm to remove stopped or exited container

# docker rm 

5- If we delete the nginx conatiner, we have the nginx image downloaded for it, to get rid of it.
images- to list images

# docker images  >> list all images along with size

to remove image 
# docker rmi nginx   >> verify no container is running using that img before attempting to remove. You must stop and delete container before deleting img.

6- pull- pull img

# docker pull img_name  >> pull img 

7- WHen we run the ubuntu container using docker run it will run and exits immediately. Why because unlike VM containers are not meant to host OS, they are meant to run specific
task or process such as to host an instance of web server or app server or DB. Once the task is complete the conatiner exists. COntainer only live as ling as process inside it 
is alive.
If the web server inside the container is stopped or crash then the container exists.
This is why when we run container from ubuntu img it stops immediately because ubuntu is just img of OS that is used as base img for other app. There is not process or application
running by default

8- To execute a command on running container use Exec.

# docker exec container_name cat /etc/hosts

9- Now when we run "docker run img_name" it runs in foreground in attached mode meaning u will be attached to console or std out of the docker container and u will see output
of the web service on ur screen. When we press ctrl+c to stop container and app hosted on container exists and u get back to ur prompt.

Another option is to run the docker container in deattached mode by providing -d option. This will run container in background mode and u will be back to ur prompt immediately.

# docker run -d img_name

10- To login to container:

# docker run -it container_name bash

By default docker container does not listen to the std input. It runs in non interactive mode.To provide our input we must map
std input of our host to docker container using -i parameter.

-it lets you run a container with an interactive terminal session so you can work inside it as if it’s a separate computer.
Without -it, you wouldn’t be able to interact with the container’s terminal directly.

11- To print only container ids

# docker ps -q

TO stop all containers at once

# docker stop $(docker ps -q)
# docker rm $(docker ps -a  -q)  >> to remove the containers
# docker rmi $docker images -q)  >> to delete all images


12- Tags:

# docker run redis:4.0  >> this is tag
# docker run redis  >> have not specify tag i.e version so it takes by default latest tag i.e latest version

13-Port mapping

When we run conatiner which has web server how we can access it. Every container get an IP address assigned by default and this
is internal IP and is only accessible within Docker host, so users outside of dockerhost cannot access this IP.
SO we need to use the IP of the docker host. We must map the port inside docker container to a free port on docker host.

# docker run -p 80:5000 apache  >> mapped port 80 of docker host to port 5000 on docker container

14- docker inspect:

To see additional details of specific container

# docker inspect container_name or id
