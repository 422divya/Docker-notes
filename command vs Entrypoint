==>Containers are not meant to host an OS
==> Containers are meant to run specific task or process, such as to host an instance of web server or app server or DB.
==> Once the task is completed the container exits
==> Container only lives as long as process inside it lives, if webs server inside the container is stopped or crashes the container exists.
  ==> SO who defines what process is run within the container?
  ==>If u look at docker file for popular docker images like nginx you will see an instruction called CMD which stands for command which defines the program that will run within
container
==> When it starts it will run nginx command =, for mysql image it is mysqld command

CMD command param1 
ex- CMD sleep 5

  ==> Now when we create img and run container, it will be running for 5 min and will exit.
  ==> What if we need to chnage the sleep time of the container currently it is hardcoded to 5 sec

1 option:
  $ docker run container_name sleep 10

  EX- $ docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10

==> But name of the image in itself implies that container will sleep, so we shouldn't have to specify the sleep command again. Instead we would like to run container as
  $ docker run ubuntu-sleep 10

  ==> We only want to pass the number of sec container should sleep and sleep command should be called automatically

==> So this can be done using ENTRYPOINT

FROM Ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"] 

==> ENTRYPOINT instruction is like the command instruction as you can specify the program that will be run when the container starts and whatever u specify on the 
command line in above case it will get appended to the entry point. So the command when container start is sleep 10

==> Incase of CMD instruction the command line parameters passed will get replaces entirely, whereas incase of ENTRYPOINT the command line parameters will get appended

==> To modify the ENTRYPOINT during runtime, we can override it by using entrypoint option in docker run command

$ docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
