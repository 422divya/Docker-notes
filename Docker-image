==> TO create our own docker image we need to create Docker file mentioning the OS, dependencies etc as below

Dockerfile
FROM Ubuntu  >> what the baseos should be for this container
RUN yum update && yum install -y python   >> RUN to run particular commands on base image
RUN pip install flask flask-mysql
COPY . /opt/source-code      >>> Copies file from local system on to the docker image
ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source-code/app.py flask run      >> ENTRYPOINT allows us to specify a command that will be run when the image is run as container

==> To build image run below
# docker build . -f Dockerfile -t custom_image


==> Each line of instructions in Dockerfile creates a new layer in Docker image
